   <b> Uncertain </b> <br> 
  
  In life's dance, tales uncertainty weave <br> 
  Shadows and whispers, in the life we retrieve <br>      
  Morning's murmur, dreams take flight <br> 
  A modern journey, through uncertain light <br> 
  Stories unfold left and right, in doubt and cheer <br>  
  Beneath the surface, where uncertainties peer <br>  
  Moments embraced, in the twists that grow <br>   
  Echoes of living, in these lines we sow <br> 
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <b> (Chorus)</b>    <br>
    Human nature, a dance with isolation,   <br>
    Victor's journey, a path of desolation.   <br>
    In the silence of the night, the Dæmon yearns,   <br>
    Learning, watching, as the world turns.   <br>
     <br>
    <b> (Verse 1)</b>    <br>
    The Dæmon, a creature of solitude,   <br>
    Observing cottagers, learning their mood.   <br>
    English whispers in the lonely room,   <br>
    Names and lives in the gathering gloom.   <br>
     <br>
    <b> (Chorus)</b>    <br>
    Human nature, a dance with isolation,   <br>
    Victor's journey, a path of desolation.   <br>
    In the silence of the night, the Dæmon yearns,   <br>
    Learning, watching, as the world turns.   <br>
     <br>
    <b> (Verse 2)</b>    <br>
    Victor's ambition, a flame that burned,   <br>
    Knowledge surpassed, lessons unlearned.   <br>
    Creation abandoned, consequences earned,   <br>
    Family lost, as the tables turned.   <br>
     <br>
    <b> (Chorus)</b>    <br>
    Human nature, a dance with isolation,   <br>
    Victor's journey, a path of desolation.   <br>
    In the silence of the night, the Dæmon yearns,   <br>
    Learning, watching, as the world turns.   <br>
     <br>
    <b> (Bridge)</b>    <br>
    A hesitant step, towards the family's grace,   <br>
    But terror ensues, they fear his face.   <br>
    Back to isolation, a heart heavy with sorrow,   <br>
    The Dæmon's existence, a dark tomorrow.   <br>
     <br>
    <b> (Outro)</b>    <br>
    In the echoes of remorse, where shadows cast,   <br>
    Ambition's price, consequences amassed.   <br>
    A cautionary tale of creation and fate,   <br>
    In the dark, they ponder the choices they make.
